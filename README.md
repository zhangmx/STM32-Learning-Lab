# STM32-Learning-Lab

Welcome to STM32-Learning-Lab! This repository is designed as a collection of example projects for learning and experimenting with STM32 microcontrollers. It includes various example codes for different STM32 development boards, such as STM32F103 and STM32F407, covering a range of experimental objectives and functionalities, including but not limited to:

-[ ] LED Blinking
-[ ] PWM Testing
-[ ] LCD Display
-[ ] Bootloader Implementation
-[ ] Additional Experimental Projects

Each example project provides detailed instructions and code samples to help developers and learners get started quickly with STM32 development. We hope this repository will become a valuable resource for your STM32 learning journey!
